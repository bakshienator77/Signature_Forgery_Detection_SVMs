Run 'VisComm' for training over the dataset and verification over cross validation set

Run 'untitled1' for starting the user interface 

'VisComm' needn't be run to run the GUI

The 'The_data_for_testing.mat' is the relevant data generated by 'VisComm'. 
It is referenced directly in the function 'Testing' which is called in 'untitled1' to save computation every time the GUI is run

In the version on Github the original data could not be uploaded.

I can make it available publicly on request.
